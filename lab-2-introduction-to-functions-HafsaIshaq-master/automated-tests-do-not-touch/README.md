# Automated testing for assignment 1

If you're a student reading this, you can definitely learn how this is tested and we'll speak of how this is done in the second level of the course.

## Students
You'll need node.js installed (this is done later in the course), you'll get there if you're reading this and you think it's neat.

## Instructors.
You can use this as not a perfect way of marking, but will add a lot of context for the student as they are working on their assignments.

1. install dependencies in this folder `npm install`
2. run the command `npm run start-and-open` pick a browser and just go take a look at the tests.
